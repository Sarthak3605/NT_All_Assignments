## Fixing Special Characters in Questions
we can use below for correcting the API generated questions and answers as sometimes it gives special characters like &quot,#28sa etc...

function decodeHTMLEntities(text) {
    let parser = new DOMParser();
    return parser.parseFromString(text, "text/html").body.textContent;
}

And apply it before displaying the text:
questionElement.textContent = decodeHTMLEntities(question.question);
options.forEach(option => {
    btn.textContent = decodeHTMLEntities(option);
});
