## Fixing Special Characters in Questions
we can use below for correcting the API generated questions and answers as sometimes it gives special characters like &quot,#28sa etc...

1. function decodeHTMLEntities(text) {
2.     let parser = new DOMParser();
3.     return parser.parseFromString(text, "text/html").body.textContent;
4. }

And apply it before displaying the text:
1. questionElement.textContent = decodeHTMLEntities(question.question);
2. options.forEach(option => {
3.     btn.textContent = decodeHTMLEntities(option);
4. });
